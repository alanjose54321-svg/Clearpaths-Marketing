      <h3>What is the typical cost of a campaign?</h3>
      <p>Costs depend on territory size, campaign length and target outcomes. We provide fixed proposals or CPA models—contact us for a custom estimate.</p>

      <h3>How do you recruit and train canvassers?</h3>
      <p>We recruit locally and provide scenario-based training, role-play, compliance, privacy and messaging rehearsals. Supervisors monitor field quality and coach teams.</p>

      <h3>Is door-to-door fundraising compliant with privacy rules?</h3>
      <p>Yes—our processes respect local privacy laws (PIPEDA or regional equivalents). We obtain explicit consent for personal data and provide secure export/handover formats.</p>

      <h3>What metrics will I receive?</h3>
      <p>We deliver daily field tallies, conversion rates, CPA, donor averages and a post-campaign summary with recommendations and raw supporter exports for CRM import.</p>

      <h3>Can you run campaigns outside my city?</h3>
      <p>Yes — we operate regionally and can scale teams to multiple locations. Logistics and pricing vary with distance and local labour availability.</p>
